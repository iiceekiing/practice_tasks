# 🖥️ CLI, Bash & Shell Tasks

This directory contains my personal practice tasks and learning notes for mastering the **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**, **Bash scripting**, and **Unix/Linux Shell commands**. These are essential skills for any developer or systems engineer.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Basic and advanced Bash commands
- File and directory manipulation
- Permissions (`chmod`, `chown`, `umask`, etc.)
- Loops and conditionals in Bash
- Shell scripting basics
- Input/output redirection
- Process management
- Automation scripts

## 📦 Structure

Each file or script covers a specific concept or task. You’ll find:

- `*.sh` → Task scripts
- `notes.txt` → Topic explanations
- `README.md` → This file

## 🎯 Goal

To become confident using the terminal for everyday developer and DevOps workflows, and to prepare for shell-related assessments and real-world tasks.
