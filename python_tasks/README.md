# 🐍 Python Tasks

This directory is a collection of beginner-to-intermediate **Python practice tasks**. It supports my learning journey as I grow from the basics to building real-world tools using Python.

## 🧩 Topics Practiced

- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if, elif, else)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and parameters
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Input/output and string manipulation
- Projects like to-do apps, calculators, etc.

## 🛠️ Structure

- Each task in a separate `.py` file
- Clear comments for learning reference
- Occasional `README.md` or `notes.txt` for grouped topics
- Practice mini-projects with input/output

## 🎯 Goal

To master Python fundamentals through active hands-on tasks and build useful scripts and mini tools that help reinforce what I learn.
